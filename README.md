# Discord AI Assistant
### Detailed readme coming soon
A personal assistant based around GPT4o and the assistant's API that takes some effort out of life. Core functions currently available:
 - Memories (fuzzy search, create/recall/destroy)
 - Reminders (fuzzy search, create/find/list/destroy)
 - Wikipedia (get page content, get references)
 - Youtube (search youtube, get transcript)

I plan to make a video tutorial on how to create your own command but the tl;dr is create your own function and import it in ToolManager.py
and then create an entry in the list of available tools with "tool_id" being the assistant's json (on openai platform) and "method" being a reference to your function

Feel free to hit me up in the meantime if you have any questions, might take me some time to get back to you but happy to help!
I'm all about making life easier :)
